# StateDB

## Summary

Package statedb contains the implementation of StateDB, a database-backed
structure that holds the state of the blockchain indexed by version (each
version corresponding to the state at each block). The StateDB holds a dynamic
hierarchy of linked merkle trees starting with the mainTree on top. 
The keys and values of all merkle trees can be cryptographically
represented by a single hash, the StateDB.Hash (which corresponds to the
mainTree.Root).

## Internals

Internally all subTrees of the StateDB use the same database (for views) and
the same transaction (for a block update). Database prefixes are used to split
the storage of each subTree while avoiding collisions. The structure of
prefixes is detailed here:
- subTree: `{KindID}{id}/`
	- arbo.Tree: `t/`
	- subTrees: `s/`
		- contains any number of subTree
	- nostate: `n/`
	- metadata: `m/`
		- versions: `v/` (only in mainTree)
			- currentVersion: `current` -> {currentVersion}
			- version to root: `{version}` -> `{root}`

Since the mainTree is unique and doesn't have a parent, the prefixes used in
the mainTree skip the first element of the path (`{KindID}{id}/`).
- Example:
	- mainTree arbo.Tree: `t/`
	- processTree arbo.Tree (a singleton under mainTree): `s/process/t/`
	- censusTree arbo.Tree (a non-singleton under processTree):
	`s/process/s/census{pID}/t/` (we are using pID, the processID as the id
	of the subTree)
	- voteTree arbo.Tree (a non-singleton under processTree):
	`s/process/s/vote{pID}/t/` (we are using pID, the processID as the id
	of the subTree)

Each tree has an associated database that can be accessed via the NoState
method. These databases are auxiliary key-values that don't belong to the
blockchain state, and thus values in the NoState databases won't be
reflected in the StateDB.Hash. One of the use cases for the NoState database is
to store auxiliary mappings used to optimize the capacity usage of the merkle trees
used for zk-SNARKS, where the tree height is a critical matter. For
example, we may want to build a census tree of babyjubjub public keys that will
be used by voters to prove, via a SNARK, that they are in the census and eligible 
to vote with their public key. If we build the merkle tree using the public key 
as the path, we will have an unbalanced tree which requires more levels than 
strictly necessary. On the other hand, if we use a sequential index as the path 
and set the value to the public key, we achieve a balanced tree, thus reducing 
the height of the tree.
The downside of this strategy is that it take away our ability to easily query 
for the existence of an arbitrary public key in the tree when 
generating a proof, as the index must be known. Thankfully we can
store the mapping of public keys to indexes in the NoState database, 
avoiding this dilemma. 

## Usage

By default the StateDB has a single tree that will be the parent of all
subTrees: the mainTree.

The StateDB is updated via transactions. When starting a new transaction
(`TreeTx`), you will also get a pointer to the mainTree (via a `TreeUpdate`
type). When committing a transaction you must specify the version for the
update.

```go
mainTree, err := sdb.BeginTx()
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)
defer mainTree.Discard()

mainTree.Add([]byte("key"), []byte("value"))

mainTree.Commit(1)
```

The `TreeTx` and all `TreeUpdate`s derived from it are not thread-safe.

You can get a read-only view of a committed version of the StateDB via the
`TreeView` types. Passing `nil` to `StateDB.TreeView` will return the last
committed version.

```go
mainTree, err := sdb.TreeView(nil)
value, err := mainTree.Get([]byte("key"))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)
qt.Assert(t, value, qt.DeepEquals, []byte("value"))
```

Each subTree can contain other subTrees. Singleton subTrees are those that are
unique, whereas NonSingleton subTrees can have many instances of the same type,
identified by a different key. To use a subTree you must first define its configuration:

The following example is a Singleton subTree that stores its root as the
entire value of the parent leaf:
```go
func rootLeafGetRoot(value []byte) ([]byte, error) {
	if len(value) != defaultHashLen {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("len(value) = %v != %v", len(value), defaultHashLen)
	}
	return value, nil
}

func rootLeafSetRoot(value []byte, root []byte) ([]byte, error) {
	if len(value) != defaultHashLen {
		return nil, fmt.Errorf("len(value) = %v != %v", len(value), defaultHashLen)
	}
	return root, nil
}

ProcessesCfg = statedb.NewTreeSingletonConfig(statedb.TreeParams{
  HashFunc:     arbo.HashFunctionSha256,
  KindID:      "procs",
  MaxLevels:     256,
  ParentLeafGetRoot: rootLeafGetRoot,
  ParentLeafSetRoot: rootLeafSetRoot,
})
```

Before we can access a subTree, it must be created. We do this by creating the
parent leaf that will contain its root and then opening the SubTree once.
```go
mainTree, err := sdb.BeginTx()
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)
defer mainTree.Discard()

err := mainTree.Add(ProcessesCfg.Key(), make([]byte, ProcessesCfg.HashFunc().Len()))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)

_, err := mainTree.SubTree(ProcessesCfg)
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)

mainTree.Commit(0)
```

The subTrees are accessed directly with the `SubTree` function, available both in `TreeUpdate` and `TreeView`:
```go
mainTree, err := sdb.BeginTx()
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)
defer mainTree.Discard()

processes, err := mainTree.SubTree(ProcessesCfg)
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)

err := processes.Add([]byte("processID"), []byte("marshalled process"))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)

mainTree.Commit(3)
```

Using a NonSingleton subTree is very similar, but requires specifying a
subTree key in the tree configuration:
```go
census, err := processes.SubTree(CensusCfg.WithKey([]byte("processID")))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)

err := census.Add([]byte("nullifier"), []byte("censusKey"))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)
```

Apart from leaves identified by a path (key) and a value, each subTree has a
key-value storage that doesn't change the StateDB cryptographic integrity, the
`NoState`. This storage should only be used for auxiliary data like mappings
and indexes.

```go
noState := processes.NoState()
err := noState.Set([]byte("NumProcsAnon"), []byte("42"))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)

value, err := noState.Get([]byte("NumProcsAnon"))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)
qt.Assert(t, value, qt.DeepEquals, []byte("value"))
```

Both `TreeUpdate` and `TreeView` implement the `TreeViewer` interface, which
contains all the read-only methods. This allows reusing code for reading from
the StateDB either from a committed state or from the current update.

Usually we will have several levels of subTrees that we need to traverse until
we reach the desired subTree. For better ergonomics when we don't care about
the parent subTrees, we can use the set of `Deep*` functions, which act the same
way as the regular `Get`, `Set`, `SubTree` functions, but allow passing a list
of tree configurations so that the operation is applied to the last one. For
example, the example above where we added a key in the census tree could have
been done like this:

```go
err := mainTree.DeepAdd([]byte("nullifier"), []byte("censusKey"), 
 ProcessesCfg, CensusCfg.WithKey([]byte("processID")))
qt.Assert(t, err, qt.IsNotNil)
```
