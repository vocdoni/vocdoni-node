Returns the publication status of a specific census by its ID, including the IPFS URI where it's uploaded, if available. This handler checks whether a census has been published successfully and retrieves its access URI or any errors that occurred during the publication process.

This endpoint can be useful for anyone looking to verify the publication status of a census, and it facilitates accessing the published data directly through the returned URI.
